# CSE258-Assignment2

This is the assignment 2 of the UCSD CSE258 Recommender System and Web Mining.

We utilized the Goodreads Book Graph Dataset and predicted if there are spoiler in the reviews.

We implemented four methods:
- Feature engineering and classification with logistic regression
- Text classification by fine-tuning BERT
- Text classification with LSTM
- BERT vector + feature engineering, classified using an MLP.

Link for the dataset: https://mengtingwan.github.io/data/goodreads. For the spoiler detection task, we only used the goodreads_reviews_spoiler and the detailed book graph to map the book titles and descriptions with the book ID.
